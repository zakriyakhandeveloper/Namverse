## 4. Structured Data Improvements

### 4.1 Organization Schema Enhanced

| Property | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `@id` | Missing | `https://nameverse.site/#organization` |
| `sameAs` | Twitter only | Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn |
| `foundingDate` | Missing | 2025 |
| `numberOfEmployees` | Missing | 5-20 |
| `contactPoint` | Missing | Email + contact URL |

### 4.2 New Schema Types Added

- **Speakable schema** (`getSpeakableSpecification`): Voice search optimization with CSS selectors for hero title, meaning summary, quick answer

### 4.3 Schema Types Now Available

---

## 5. Technical SEO Fixes

### 5.1 hreflang Tags Fixed

**Issue:** All hreflang tags (ur, ar, hi, bn, tr, fa) pointed to the same English URL, which is invalid and misleading.

**Fix:** Removed all conditional hreflang tags. Now only emits:
- `<link rel="alternate" hrefLang="en" href={pageUrl} />`
- `<link rel="alternate" hrefLang="x-default" href={pageUrl} />`

**Note:** True multilingual hreflang requires separate translated routes. These should be added when translation routes are implemented.

### 5.2 Canonical Tags

All pages now use proper self-referencing canonical URLs. Homepage canonical is clean (no language alternates that could cause confusion).

### 5.3 Double Branding Eliminated

**Issue:** Homepage title had "NameVerse — ... | NameVerse" — brand appearing twice.

**Fix:** Title generator now strips double branding with regex: `/\| NameVerse\s*\| NameVerse/g`
