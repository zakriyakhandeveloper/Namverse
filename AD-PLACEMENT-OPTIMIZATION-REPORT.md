## UX Improvements Made

1. **No More Popups/Popunders**: Users will never experience unwanted new tabs or windows opening
2. **No Intrusive Overlays**: Removed the 8-second delayed sidebar that blocked content
3. **No Sticky Bottom Banners**: Removed the fixed-position ad that covered content
4. **Native In-Content Placement**: Ads flow naturally within the content reading experience
5. **Proper Spacing**: Each ad has `my-6` (24px) margin above and below
6. **Reserved Space**: `minHeight` prevents layout shift (CLS)
7. **ARIA Labels**: `role="complementary"` and `aria-label="Sponsored content"` for accessibility
8. **Responsive Design**: `w-full mx-auto px-2 sm:px-4` ensures proper sizing on all devices
9. **No Horizontal Scroll**: `overflow-hidden` prevents ad overflow

---

## Performance Improvements Made

1. **Lazy Loading**: IntersectionObserver loads ads only when they enter viewport (200px margin)
2. **Single Script Load**: Native ad script loads once globally, not per-instance
3. **No Re-renders**: `useRef` prevents duplicate script/container creation
4. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed 4 components (FixedBottomBanner, SidebarSlideIn, AdBanner, AdSlot)
5. **No Global Ad Script**: Removed RevolthemAds from root layout — ads only load on content pages
6. **CLS Prevention**: `minHeight` prop reserves space before ad content loads
7. **Reduced DOM Manipulation**: No more body-firstChild insertion or global script injection
